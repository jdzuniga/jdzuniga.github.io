Hi, I'm David, a data scientist with a background in mathematics, statistics, and computer science.

This blog is a space where I share my personal projects and experiments. I enjoy coding and exploring data to solve real problems using AI. My main interests are artificial intelligence and robotics, and I use this site to document my progress and discoveries in those fields.
