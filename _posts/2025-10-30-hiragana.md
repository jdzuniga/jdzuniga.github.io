<p>
Hiragana (ひらがな) is a phonetic Japanese writing system used for native Japanese words and grammatical elements. It is one of three scripts used in the language, along with katakana and kanji.
In this project, the goal is to demonstrate how effectively a simple Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) can classify handwritten Hiragana characters. The dataset contains 270,912 handwritten samples, each represented as a 28×28 grayscale image corresponding to one of 49 possible symbols (46 basic characters plus a few additional sounds).
</p>
<h3>Objective</h3>
<p>
The goal is to correctly classify a Hiragana symbol drawn on a digital pad. To achieve this, the user’s drawing must first be rescaled and preprocessed before being fed into the model.
Since there are 49 possible classes, a random guess would yield roughly 2% accuracy, assuming balanced classes (the dataset is highly imbalanced).
</p>

<h3>Baseline Models</h3>
<p>
Before applying deep learning, it’s good practice to start with simple, interpretable models to justify the use of neural networks:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Heuristic Model: Always predict the most frequent class in the training set.
  Accuracy: ≈10% on the test set.</li>
    
  <li>Naive Bayes Model: Assumes independence between pixel features (an unrealistic but useful baseline). Accuracy: ≈30% on the test set.</li>
</ul>
These results provide context for how well traditional approaches perform.

<h3>CNN Model</h3>
<p>
The Convolutional Neural Network was then trained on the same data. It achieved an impressive 90% test accuracy, far surpassing both the heuristic and Naive Bayes models. This confirms the effectiveness of CNNs for image-based classification tasks, even with simple architectures.
</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
This experiment shows how model complexity impacts performance on handwritten character recognition. The CNN captures spatial dependencies that classical models overlook, yielding a major improvement in accuracy.

The full analysis, including data exploration, PCA visualization, and the interactive web application, is available in the project repository [here](https://github.com/jdzuniga/hiragana).
