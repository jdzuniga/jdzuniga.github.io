    In the competitive world of anime distribution, licensing decisions can make or break a streaming platform's success. This project presents an interactive dashboard that transforms raw anime industry data into actionable insights, helping content licensors identify high-potential titles before they become mainstream hits.
</p>
<p>
    Anime licensors face a critical challenge: which upcoming titles should they invest in? With hundreds of new anime releases each year and limited budgets, making the wrong choice can result in significant financial losses. Traditional methods rely heavily on gut feeling, franchise recognition, or waiting to see what becomes popular—by which time licensing costs have skyrocketed.
</p>


<h3>The Challenge</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        With over 300 titles released annually, identifying which shows will resonate with audiences is increasingly difficult
    </li>
    <li>
        Licensing fees for popular titles can range from tens of thousands to millions of dollars
    </li>
    <li>
        Licensors need to predict success before a show airs.
    </li>
    <li>
        Genre trends shift rapidly, making historical data less reliable
    </li>
    <li>
        Studio reputation varies significantly in hit rate
    </li>
</ul>


<h3>The Solution</h3>
<p>
I built an interactive decision support dashboard that aggregates multiple data dimensions to provide a comprehensive view of the licensing landscape. The tool enables stakeholders to evaluate upcoming titles based on quantitative predictions rather than intuition alone.

<h3>Core Features</h3>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Predictive Scoring System</strong>: The dashboard displays predicted scores for upcoming titles, calculated using a machine learning model trained on historical anime performance data. This allows licensors to identify potential breakout hits early in the production cycle.</li>
    <li><strong>Genre Trend Analysis</strong>: The dashboard tracks genre popularity over time, revealing crucial patterns. The visualization shows that Action and Fantasy have maintained relatively stable popularity from 2020-2026, while Romance experienced a notable surge in 2025 before declining. These insights help licensors align their acquisitions with current audience preferences rather than past trends.</li>
    <li><strong>Studio Performance Metrics</strong>: The dashboard ranks studios by both their hit rate for upcoming titles and their average member engagement. This dual perspective helps licensors understand which studios consistently produce popular content and which have large, engaged fanbases.</li>
    <li><strong>Comprehensive Title Rankings</strong>: A sortable table presents all upcoming titles with their predicted scores, studios, genres, expected members, and engagement rates. Licensors can filter by studio and year range, enabling targeted analysis of specific market segments.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Key Insights</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        Studio consistency matters: Top-tier studios (Studio Bind, Gekkou) maintain 80%+ hit rates, while mid-tier studios show more variability
    </li>
    <li>
        Genre diversification: Single-genre shows perform less reliably than those blending complementary genres (Action + Adventure + Fantasy)
    </li>
    <li>
        Engagement doesn't equal quality: Some high-scoring titles have modest engagement, suggesting niche appeal versus mainstream popularity
    </li>
    <li>
        Seasonal patterns: Clear cyclical trends in genre popularity suggest optimal timing for different content types
    </li>
</ul>


<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>
The anime industry generates billions in revenue annually, yet many licensing decisions still rely on limited information and industry instinct. This Anime Licensing Decision Support system demonstrates how data analytics can augment human expertise, reducing risk and improving portfolio performance.
By combining predictive modeling, trend analysis, and comprehensive studio intelligence, the platform empowers licensors to make confident, data-backed decisions in an increasingly competitive market. It's not about replacing human judgment—it's about giving decision-makers the insights they need to trust their instincts.
