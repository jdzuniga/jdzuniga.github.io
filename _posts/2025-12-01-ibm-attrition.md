Employee attrition can be costly and disruptive for companies. This project explores IBM employee data to identify key drivers of turnover and actionable strategies to retain high-risk employee groups. The dataset used for this project is available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pavansubhasht/ibm-hr-analytics-attrition-dataset).

Using descriptive analysis and interactive dashboards in Tableau, I explored attrition patterns across job roles, tenure, training, and overtime. The goal was to turn data into actionable insights for HR decision-making.

### Key findings
- Four roles—Laboratory Technician, Sales Executive, Sales Representative, and Research Scientist—accounted for **84%** of total attrition
- Employees who left tended to have fewer years at the company
- Those who left had lower training exposure
- Over **50%** of leavers were working overtime

These patterns suggest retention efforts should focus on early-career employees in high-risk roles, workload management, and targeted training programs.

The project includes a Google Slides presentation with actionable insights and a Tableau dashboard for interactive exploration of employee attrition patterns.
